# This is my personal website initially developed as a class assignment.
# Having been an assignment, I happened to make it a reality to begin developing my first official website
# In the long run, I will be updating this website timely as a reference or my portfolio to publish my achievements

This is generally a static website however might contain links that will redirect users to dynamic webpages. The 
website has:
- a landing page (index.html) that briefly highlights the contents of the website.
- a resume page (resume.html), that has my resume as well
- a contacts page 
- a link to projects, that is, to my Github account where you can check on my projects.
